# Medium-Level Ansible Interview Questions and Answers

## General Concepts

### 1. Explain the difference between `playbook`, `task`, and `role` in Ansible.
- **Playbook**: A YAML file containing a list of plays to be run.
- **Task**: A single action to be performed on a host, like installing a package or copying a file.
- **Role**: A structured way of organizing playbooks and other Ansible components like tasks, handlers, templates, etc.

### 2. How does Ansible handle idempotency, and why is it important?
- Ansible modules are idempotent, meaning they only make changes when required. This ensures repeatability and prevents unintended side effects.

### 3. What are Ansible facts? How can you gather and use them in playbooks?
- Facts are system properties (OS, IP, memory) gathered using the `setup` module.
- Use them in playbooks via `{{ ansible_facts['hostname'] }}`.

### 4. What is the purpose of an `inventory` file? Can you use dynamic inventories?
- It defines the list of hosts managed by Ansible.
- Yes, dynamic inventories can be used via external scripts or cloud plugins.

### 5. What are the different types of variables in Ansible and their precedence order?
- Types: inventory vars, playbook vars, role vars, extra vars, etc.
- Precedence: extra vars > task vars > block vars > role vars > inventory vars > facts > default vars

## Playbooks and Roles

### 6. How do you include or import playbooks, tasks, and roles in Ansible?
- Use `import_playbook`, `import_tasks`, `include_tasks`, or define `roles` in a play.

### 7. What is the difference between `include` and `import` in playbooks?
- `import` is static and resolved at playbook parsing time.
- `include` is dynamic and resolved during playbook execution.

### 8. How do you use handlers in Ansible? Give an example scenario.
- Handlers are triggered by `notify`. Used for actions like restarting a service after a config change.

### 9. What is a `when` statement? How do you use conditionals in Ansible?
- Itâ€™s used to run tasks conditionally. Example: `when: ansible_os_family == 'Debian'`.

### 10. Explain the structure of an Ansible role and how to create a reusable one.
- Roles have directories like `tasks`, `handlers`, `defaults`, `vars`, etc. Create with `ansible-galaxy init role_name`.

## Templates, Variables, and Filters

### 11. How do you use Jinja2 templates in Ansible?
- Use `.j2` files with variables and render using the `template` module.

### 12. How can you encrypt sensitive data using Ansible Vault?
- Encrypt files with `ansible-vault encrypt file.yml`, and decrypt or edit securely with corresponding commands.

### 13. Give an example of using Ansible filters in a template.
- Example: `{{ some_list | join(', ') }}` joins list items into a string.

### 14. How do you pass extra variables to a playbook at runtime?
- Use `-e` flag: `ansible-playbook playbook.yml -e "var1=value1"`

## Advanced Topics

### 15. Explain how Ansible connects to remote machines. What are `become` and `become_user` used for?
- Ansible uses SSH to connect. `become` allows privilege escalation, and `become_user` defines the user to become.

### 16. How would you write a playbook to deploy an application to multiple environments (dev/stage/prod)?
- Use group_vars or environment-specific variables, and conditionally load them based on the inventory group or tags.

### 17. Describe how to debug Ansible playbooks. What are some best practices for debugging?
- Use `-vvv` verbosity, `debug` module, and `ansible-playbook --step`. Modular playbooks and descriptive task names help.

### 18. What is `check mode` in Ansible? When would you use it?
- Use `--check` to simulate changes without applying them. Useful for testing playbook behavior.

### 19. What are callback plugins in Ansible? Have you customized any?
- Plugins that alter output or behavior. Example: `json`, `yaml`, or `slack` notification plugins. Yes, they can be customized.

### 20. Have you integrated Ansible with CI/CD pipelines? Explain how.
- Yes, by invoking Ansible playbooks from Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions for deployment and configuration automation.
